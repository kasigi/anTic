This is a php + angular application that can be used to track issues in a project.

This is not intended as a fully supported long-term project but a one-off creation with two goals:
--Continue to Learn Angular
--Have an internal task tracking tool

Note: I'm using this tool BEHIND firewalls and with a server that provides authentication before the site is even reached.  Do NOT deploy this tool directly on public-facing IP's without adding a layer of security on top.  This is largely a learning tool and is not intended for production.
